## Other Editable Content

### Already Working (No ACF needed):
- ✅ **Blog Posts** - Posts > All Posts
- ✅ **Testimonials** - Testimonials > All Testimonials
- ✅ **Gallery Images** - Gallery Images > Add New

### Intentionally NOT Editable (Strategic Content):
- 🔒 **Wedding Spotlight section** - Core messaging, rarely changes
- 🔒 **Services section** - Service offerings are stable
- 🔒 **Pricing packages** - Strategic pricing, should be updated carefully
- 🔒 **Process steps** - Fixed workflow
- 🔒 **FAQ questions** - Carefully crafted answers

**Why keep these hard-coded?**
- They don't change frequently enough to justify complexity
- Reduces risk of accidentally breaking layouts
- Keeps WordPress admin clean and simple
- When updates are needed, contact your developer

**Note:** This keeps your client from accidentally changing important strategic content!

## Tips for Editing

### Text Fields
- Keep titles concise and punchy
- Avoid making descriptions too long

### Image Fields
- Click "Add Image" button
- Upload new image or select from Media Library
- Recommended image sizes:
  - My Story photo: 400x400px or larger
  - Should be good quality but not huge file size

### WYSIWYG Editor (Bio Content)
- Use the visual editor just like Microsoft Word
- **Bold** important phrases
- Break content into paragraphs
- Don't worry about HTML - the editor handles it

## Troubleshooting

**Q: I don't see "Homepage Settings" in the sidebar**
- Make sure ACF plugin is activated (Plugins > Installed Plugins)
- Try refreshing the page

**Q: Changes aren't showing on the homepage**
- Make sure you clicked "Publish" or "Update"
- Try clearing browser cache (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
- Some hosts cache pages - wait a minute and refresh

**Q: I want to go back to the default text**
- Just delete your custom text from the field
- Leave it empty
- Save, and it will show the original default text
