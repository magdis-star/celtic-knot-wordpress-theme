# How to Add Theme Screenshot

A screenshot makes your theme look professional in WordPress Appearance > Themes page.

## Quick Instructions

1. **Take a screenshot** of the homepage (or design a preview image)
2. **Name it**: `screenshot.png` or `screenshot.jpg`
3. **Recommended size**: 1200px wide × 900px tall (4:3 ratio)
4. **Place it** in the theme root folder (same level as style.css)

## Step-by-Step

### Option 1: Use Homepage Screenshot

1. Open the website homepage
2. Take a full-page screenshot
3. Crop/resize to 1200×900px
4. Save as `screenshot.png`
5. Upload to theme folder root

### Option 2: Create Custom Preview

Design a nice preview showing:
- Theme name "Tie the Celtic Knot"
- Brief description
- Key colors (greens, white)
- Maybe a sample of the hero section

### Where to Put It

```
celtic-knot-wordpress-theme/
├── style.css
├── functions.php
├── front-page.php
├── screenshot.png     ← PUT IT HERE!
└── images/
    └── ...
```

## WordPress Requirements

**File name (must be exact):**
- ✅ `screenshot.png` (preferred)
- ✅ `screenshot.jpg` (also works)
- ❌ `Screenshot.png` (wrong - case sensitive)
- ❌ `theme-screenshot.png` (wrong - wrong name)

**Recommended dimensions:**
- **Ideal**: 1200px × 900px (4:3 ratio)
- **Minimum**: 880px × 660px
- **Alternative**: 1200px × 600px (2:1 ratio also works)

**File size:**
- Keep under 500KB for fast loading
- Use JPG if PNG is too large

## Easy Method Using Mac

1. Open the website in browser
2. Take screenshot: `Cmd + Shift + 4`, then drag to select
3. Find screenshot on Desktop
4. Open in Preview app
5. **Tools > Adjust Size** → 1200 width, keep proportions
6. **File > Export** as PNG
7. Rename to `screenshot.png`
8. Move to theme root folder

## Using Online Tool

1. Take any screenshot of the site
2. Go to: https://www.iloveimg.com/resize-image
3. Upload your screenshot
4. Resize to 1200×900px
5. Download

## Where It Appears

After adding the screenshot, it will show in:

- Theme preview when hovering over the theme
- Makes it easy to identify your theme

## Current Workaround (If You Don't Have Time)

If you want to skip this for now:
1. WordPress will show a blank/default preview
2. The theme still works perfectly
3. You can add a screenshot later anytime

## After Adding

1. Re-zip the theme with screenshot included
2. Upload to WordPress
3. Go to **Appearance > Themes**
4. You'll see your nice screenshot!
