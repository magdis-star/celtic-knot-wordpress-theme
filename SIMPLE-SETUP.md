## How to Edit Content (Later):

### Option 1: Simple Way - Edit the Template File
The client can hire you or a developer to edit `/front-page.php` to change any text, prices, or content.

### Option 2: Advanced Way - Install ACF Plugin (Optional)
If the client wants to edit content themselves without code:

1. Install "Advanced Custom Fields" plugin (free)
2. Create field group with fields for hero text, section titles, etc.
3. Set location to "Options Page = Homepage Settings"
4. Then a "Homepage Settings" menu will appear where client can edit all text

**But this is NOT required** - the site works perfectly right now!

## Blog Usage:

- Go to **Posts > Add New** to write blog posts
- Add featured images (will show on blog page)
- Blog automatically appears on homepage and at `/blog`

## Need Help?

All content is in the `/front-page.php` file. Any developer can edit it easily - it's all standard HTML with inline CSS.
