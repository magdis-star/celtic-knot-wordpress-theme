SCREENSHOT.PNG NOTE
==================

WordPress themes traditionally include a screenshot.png file (1200x900px) showing the theme's homepage.

To add a screenshot:
1. Take a screenshot of the homepage when it's set up
2. Resize to 1200x900 pixels
3. Save as "screenshot.png" in this folder
4. This will appear in WordPress Appearance > Themes

For now, the theme will work without it, but adding one makes it look more professional in the WordPress admin.
