# Dashboard Cleanup - Removed Duplicate "Services"

## What Changed

**REMOVED:**
- ❌ "Services" (with heart icon) - This was NOT being used on the website

**KEPT:**
- ✅ "Other Services" (now with people/groups icon) - This IS used for Child Naming, Funerals, etc.
- ✅ "Service Packages" (with star icon) - This IS used for pricing packages

## Why the Confusion?

There were two similar custom post types in the dashboard:
1. **Services** - Old, unused, not displayed anywhere
2. **Other Services** - Active, displays on homepage

Both had heart icons, making them confusing.

## What Your Dashboard Looks Like Now

After updating the theme, you'll see:

```
WordPress Dashboard Menu:

📊 Posts
📄 Pages
💬 Comments
⭐ Service Packages        ← Pricing packages ($300, $450, etc.)
👥 Other Services          ← Ceremonies (Child Naming, Funerals)
💬 Testimonials
🖼️ Gallery Images
📰 Media
👤 Users
🎨 Appearance
🔌 Plugins
⚙️ Settings
```

## Clear Distinction Now

**Service Packages** ⭐
- For pricing/packages
- Basic Signing, Custom Ceremony, Full Service, Deluxe
- Star icon

**Other Services** 👥
- For other ceremonies
- Child Naming, Funerals, etc.
- People/groups icon

## Will This Delete Anything?

**No!** This only removes the unused menu item. Your actual content is safe:
- ✅ All "Other Services" you created stay
- ✅ All "Service Packages" you created stay
- ✅ All images and content stays

The old "Services" section was never being used on the website anyway, so removing it just cleans up your dashboard.

## After Update

Your dashboard will be cleaner and less confusing - just the two sections you actually need!
