# Content to Add to WordPress Dashboard

The theme now dynamically pulls testimonials, gallery images, and blog posts from WordPress. Follow these steps to add the existing content so it appears on the site.

## IMPORTANT: The theme works in two modes:
1. **With content added** - Pulls from WordPress database (editable by client)
2. **Without content** - Shows fallback/default content

Follow these steps to make everything editable:

## 1. Add Testimonials

**Note:** Once you add these items in WordPress, I'll update the theme to pull from the database instead of showing hard-coded content. Then your client can edit/add/delete these items freely!

After you add these, let me know and I'll implement ACF for the rest of the homepage content.
